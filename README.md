# Isula: A Framework for Ant Colony Algorithms

Isula allows an easy implementation of Ant-Colony Optimization algorithms using the Java Programming Language. It contains the common elements present in the meta-heuristic to allow algorithm designers the reutilization of common behaviours. With Isula, solving optimization problems with Ant Colony can be done in few lines of code.
